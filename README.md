# Speech Recognition using Python

This project demonstrates a simple speech recognition system that records audio, reduces noise, enhances the audio signal, and recognizes speech using the Google Web Speech API.

## Features
- **Noise Reduction**: Uses the `noisereduce` library to reduce background noise.
- **Audio Effects**: Applies filters such as noise gate, compressor, low-shelf filter, and gain using `Pedalboard`.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts the enhanced audio to text using the Google Web Speech API with the `SpeechRecognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Text-to-speech conversion is done using the `pyttsx3` library.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* SpeechRecognition 
* pyttsx3 
* noisereduce 
* sounddevice 
* numpy 
* scipy 
* pedalboard

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works

1. **Audio Recording**: Records audio input from the microphone for 5 seconds.
2. **Noise Reduction & Audio Enhancement**: 
    - First, background noise is reduced using `noisereduce`.
    - Then, a series of audio effects are applied using `Pedalboard`, such as noise gate, compressor, low-shelf filter, and gain.
3. **Speech Recognition**: The enhanced audio is then processed to recognize and convert speech to text using the Google Web Speech API.
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Optionally, the recognized text can be converted into speech output (this feature is not explicitly used in the current loop but initialized).
5. **Termination**: The program will exit if the recognized text is 'exit'.

## Code Structure

- **`record_audio()`**: Captures audio for a specified duration using the microphone and `sounddevice`.
- **`enhance_audio()`**: Reduces noise and applies audio effects (noise gate, compressor, low-shelf filter, and gain).
- **Main Loop**: Continuously listens for audio, enhances it, recognizes the speech, and prints the recognized text. The loop exits when the word 'exit' is recognized.

## Usage

To run the project, simply execute the script. The program will:

1. Record audio for 5 seconds.
2. Enhance the audio by reducing noise and applying effects.
3. Recognize and print the spoken text.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Improvements
- Couldn't implement WhisperX due to hardware restrictions.
